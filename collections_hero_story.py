# A dictionary is an abstract data type that defines an unordered collection of data as a set of key-value pairs.
# Each key, which must be unique, has an associated value.

    "Middle": "One night whilst he was roaming the streets, making sure everyone was tucked safely into bed; he saw something that shocked him",
    "End": "It was his long time friend who he hasb't seen in over a decade. But what surprised him even more is what he was doing",
